I usually cut/break 14 pills in half in one sitting so I can stock my pill box for 2 weeks at a time. But, for some odd and unknown reason, it would cut the first pill perfectly, then the next 2 would be crushed, then I'll get 1 or 2 more cut perfectly, then a few crushed ones .. lather, rinse, repeat.<br />Between the near impossibility of opening the damn thing (seriously y'all, think of the people who have difficulty using their hands!), and the random selection of cut or crushed, it makes it useless.
