First impression was I like the size, it\u2019s able to fit larger pills like my vitamins. My main complaint is the clasp somewhat broke. It doesn\u2019t click locked when I close it, but if I hold down the button while closing it and then release the button it stays locked. So, luckily it still works, but I don\u2019t expect it to last very long. If you\u2019re looking for something to last a while and be used a lot, I would look elsewhere."}]
